This blog has been created as a course assignment, but it’s more than that. I’m about to dive into a completely new world and familiarize myself with a new language. I used to be lazy when it came to learning technological tools, but it was actually my studies in religious studies that inspired me to explore the digital world. Nothing seems sacred in technology, but I’m not trying to prepare myself to fight with God using digital tools. I just want to find a well-paid job. God, please forgive me!

The name of the website and its description are borrowed from my favorite story in the Bible
